# A Simple Blog Website
This is a simple blog app I built using Node.js, Express, and EJS templating. It lets you create, view, and delete blog posts easily. Since there’s no database involved, the posts only last while the server is running — once you stop it, everything disappears. It’s a great way to learn the basics of web development, like handling routes, forms, and displaying dynamic content.
The homepage shows all posts, you can click a post to read it, and use a form to add new posts. There’s also a delete button to remove posts.

It’s great for learning how to handle routes, forms, and dynamic pages. To run it, just clone, install dependencies, and start the server. Then visit http://localhost:3000.
